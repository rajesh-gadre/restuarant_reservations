## 11. Open Questions

1. Which platform(s) should we target first (iOS, Android, Web)? Web is a must.
2. Do we require an in-app calling integration (e.g., Twilio) or rely on native dialer? Please let me know what the choices are and what the trade-offs are.
3. Will there be a restaurant-side admin portal to manage calls and reservations? No.
4. Should we support SMS/email notifications, and which provider(s)? No.
5. Do you have initial restaurant data sources or API integrations in mind? No. Ask the user to specify the restaurant name and phone number.
